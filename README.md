# Nutrition-Optimization

Welcome to this Food and nutrition planning optimization tool!

The goal is to create a tool to provide individuals with a recommended diet based on their personal health needs.

The model currently used is the the DOcplex linear optimization solver, and it has been built on IBM Watson Studio.

# Things to add:
- A better error message if the solution is not feasible i.e. the food options will not meet the desired nutritional requirements. 
- Add a web scraper for the costs of each food item or a REST api connection.
- Add an option to input your gender / age and actiivty level to ensure the nutritional requirements are set to the individual.
